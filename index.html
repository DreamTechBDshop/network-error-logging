    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Accurately measuring performance characteristics of web applications is an important aspect in helping site developers understand how to make their web applications faster. Likewise, measuring and understanding when web applications are not accessible for end users due to network errors is an example of the worst case web browsing performance.</p>

    <p>Today, application developers do not have real-time web application availability data from their end users. For example, if the user fails to load the page due to a network error, such as a failed DNS lookup, a connection timeout, a reset connection, or other reasons, the site developer is unable to detect and address this issue. Existing methods, such as synthetic monitoring provide a partial solution by placing monitoring nodes in predetermined geographic locations, but require additional infrastructure investments, and cannot provide truly global and near real-time availability data for real end users.</p>

    <p>Navigation Error Logging (<dfn>NEL</dfn>) addresses this need by defining a mechanism enabling web applications to declare a reporting policy that can be used by the user agent to report user navigation errors for a given origin. To take advantage of <a>NEL</a>, a web application opts into using <a>NEL</a> by supplying a <code>Navigation-Error-Logging</code> HTTP response header field that describes the reporting policy. Then, if the <a>NEL</a> policy is available for a given origin, and an end user fails to successfully navigate to a destination on that origin, the user agent logs the navigation error report and attempts to deliver it to the reporting URI defined by the policy - the delivery is done on a best effort basis and may be delayed due to connectivity issues or other reasons.</p>

    <p><a>NEL</a> applies to navigation requests only: a fetch resulting from a link navigation, direct user input, actions such as refresh, back, forward, or any other actions that result in a new page context. Subresource requests, such as resource fetches initiated as a result of the navigation request are not subject to <a>NEL</a>: if the parent resource has successfully loaded, the web application can implement own subresource instrumentation and error logging policies. <a>NEL</a> is only concerned with cases where no such instrumentation is possible because the application code is not yet instantiated or available and hence is unable to instrument the request.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Policy Delivery and Processing</h2>
      <p>The server delivers the <a>NEL policy</a> to the user agent via an HTTP response header field. The policy MUST be delivered over a secure transport. If the policy is delivered over a secure transport with no underlying secure transport errors or warnings, and its format conforms to the specified grammar, the user agent MUST either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Register the host as a <a>Known NEL Host</a> if it is not already registered.</li>
        <li>Update the registered policy for the <a>Known NEL Host</a> if the provided policy is different than that already stored by the user agent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Otherwise, if the policy is received over an insecure transport, or if the policy does not conform to the specified grammar, then the user agent MUST ignore it.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>`Navigation-Error-Logging` Header Field</h2>
        <p>The <dfn>Navigation-Error-Logging</dfn> header field (NEL header field) is used to communicate the <dfn>NEL policy</dfn> to the user agent. The ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the NEL header field is as follows:</p>

        <pre>
Navigation-Error-Logging = "Navigation-Error-Logging" ":" [ directive ]  *( ";" [ directive ] )

directive                 = directive-name [ "=" directive-value ]
directive-name            = token
directive-value           = token | quoted-string
        </pre>

        <p>See [[!RFC7230]] section 3.2.6 for definitions of `token` and `quoted-string`. This specification defines three NEL directives: <a>report-uri</a>, <a>max-age</a>, and <a>includeSubDomains</a>. The overall requirements for directives are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The order of appearance of directives is not significant.</li>
          <li>All directives MUST appear only once in an NEL header field. Directives are either optional or required, as stipulated in their definitions.</li>
          <li>Directive names are case-insensitive.</li>
          <li>User agents MUST ignore any NEL header field containing directives, or other header field value data, that does not conform to the syntax defined in this specification.</li>
          <li>If an NEL header field contains directive(s) not recognized by
         the user agent, the user agent MUST ignore the unrecognized directives, and if the NEL header field otherwise satisfies the above requirements, the user agent MUST process the recognized directives.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additional directives extending the semantic functionality of the NEL header field can be defined in other specifications, with a registry (having an IANA policy definition of IETF Review [[!RFC5226]]) defined for them at such time.</p>

        <p>The <a>Navigation-Error-Logging</a> header is not supported inside a <code>meta</code> element to mitigate hijacking of error reporting via scripting attacks. The <a>NEL policy</a> MUST be delivered via the NEL header field.</p>

        <p class="note">The restriction on <code>meta</code> element is consistent with [[CSP]] specification, which restricts reporting registration to HTTP header fields only for same reasons.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>The `report-uri` Directive</h2>
          <p>The REQUIRED <dfn>report-uri</dfn> directive specifies a URI to which the user agent sends reports about navigation errors. The ABNF grammar for the name and value of the directive is:</p>

          <pre>
directive-name    = "report-uri"
directive-value   = uri-reference
          </pre>

          <p>See [[!RFC3986]] section 4.1 for definitions of `uri-reference`. The provided reporting URI MUST use a secure transport to receive the NEL reports. If the provided reporting URI does not use a secure transport, the user agent MUST ignore the provided policy. The process of sending navigation error reports to the URL specified in this directive's value is defined in this documents <a href="reporting"></a> section.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The `max-age` Directive</h2>
          <p>The REQUIRED <dfn>max-age</dfn> directive specifies the number of seconds, after the reception of the NEL header field, during which the user agent regards the host (from whom the policy was received) as a <a>Known NEL Host</a>. The ABNF grammar for the name and value of the directive is:</p>

          <pre>
directive-name    = "max-age"
directive-value   = delta-seconds
          </pre>

          <p>See [[!RFC7234]] section 1.2.1 for definition of `delta-seconds`. A <a>max-age</a> value of zero (i.e. "max-age=0") signals the user agent to cease regarding the host as a Known NEL Host, including the <a>includeSubDomains</a> directive (if provided for that NEL Host).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The `includeSubDomains` Directive</h2>
          <p>The OPTIONAL <dfn>includeSubDomains</dfn> directive is a valueless directive which, if present signals the user agent that the <a>NEL policy</a> applies to this NEL Host as well as any subdomains of the host's domain name.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Policy Storage and Maintenance</h2>

      <p>An HTTP host declares iself an <dfn>NEL Host</dfn> by issuing an <a>NEL policy</a>, which is communicated via the <a>Navigation-Error-Logging</a> HTTP response header field over secure transport (e.g., TLS). Upon error-free receipt and processing of this header by a conformant user agent, the user agent regards the host as a <dfn>Known NEL Host</dfn>.</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST store and index NEL policies based strictly upon the domain names of the issuing <a title="NEL Host">NEL Hosts</a>. An <a>NEL policy</a> may contain an optional <a>includeSubDomains</a> directive specifying that this policy also applies to any hosts whose domain names are subdomains of the <a title="Known NEL Host">Known NEL Host's</a> domain name.</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST maintain the <a>NEL policy</a> of any given <a>NEL Host</a> separately from any NEL policies issued by any other <a title="NEL Host">NEL Hosts</a> whose domain names are superdomains or subdomains of the given <a title="NEL Host">NEL Host's</a> domain name. Only the given <a>NEL Host</a> can update or cause deletion of its <a>NEL policy</a>. This is accomplished by sending a <a>Navigation-Error-Logging</a> HTTP response header field to the user agent with new values for the policy reporting URI, time duration, and subdomain applicability. Thus, the user agent MUST store the "freshest" <a>NEL policy</a> information on behalf of an <a>NEL Host</a>, and specifying a zero time duration MUST cause the user agent to delete the <a>NEL policy</a> (including any asserted <a>includeSubDomains</a> directive) for that <a>NEL Host</a>.</p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Sample Policy Definitions</h2>
        <pre class="example">
           Navigation-Error-Logging: report-uri="https://example.com/errors"; max-age=2592000
        </pre>

        <p>The above heard field specifies that the user agent should report navigation errors to "https://example.com/errors" URI, and that the policy applies for 2592000 seconds (30 days).</p>

        <pre class="example">
           Navigation-Error-Logging: report-uri="https://example.com/errors"; max-age=2592000; includeSubDomains
        </pre>

        <p>The above heard field applies similar policy as previous example but also extends it to all of the subdomains of the issuing NEL host.</p>

        <pre class="example">
           Navigation-Error-Logging: report-uri="https://example.com/errors"; max-age=0
        </pre>

        <p>The above heard field with a <a>max-age</a> of zero indicates that the user agent must delete the currently registered <a>NEL policy</a> associated with the NEL Host and all of its subdomains - i.e. <a>includeSubDomains</a> is ignored when <a>max-age</a> is zero.</p>
